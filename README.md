#  Business Understanding
##### A .Introduction <br>
A real estate agent who holds a license facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers and represents them in court. Agents typically receive payment in the form of commission, which is a percentage of the sale price of the home. Depending on their state and brokerage, agents receive a different percentage.

The expansion and acceptance of technology have hastened the rapid evolution of the real estate sector. In order to meet consumer needs, this calls for agents who assist in researching current real estate market trends.
However, the agents frequently run into problems that, if ignored, will surely cause the company to fail. Low sales could be the unexpected consequence of any issues, whether they revolve around the environment, governmental regulations, volatile markets, climate change, competition, or technological advancements.

Therefore, it's important to find answers to them.

##### B.Problem statement <br>
One of the problems the real state agencies face is convincing the home owners to renovate their houses in order to get a wider market,which means more customers and a higher sale of the house.You may maintain and raise that worth by renovating your home. Remodeling projects for the kitchen, bathroom, or outside all yield very good returns on investment.


##### C.Main Objective <br>
To create and implement a predictive study using data analysis and machine learning models in order to precisely predict the some of the important factors to be considered in renovations.And show how renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

##### D.Specific Objectives <br>
* To help understand the different types of variables involved in home renovations.

* To help understand which variables have a strong correlation with the price of the homes, ie which variable is most likely help increase the price of the homes.

# Data Understanding
The data utilized for analysis is sourced from  the Kc_house_data.csv file. This tables provide relevant information for the analysis process including columns such as:
* Age
* price
* sqft_living
* sqft_above
* bedrooms
* bathrooms
It contains 21597 rows and 21 columns.

### Concusion
* Independent variables such as sqft_living and bathrooms are have a postive relationship with the dependent variable Price meaning the variables tend to move in the same direction.
* Independent variables such as sqft_above and bedrooms are have a negative relationship with the dependent variable Price meaning when the value of one variable increases, the other decreases.
* Having more bedrooms ,does not necessarily mean that the renovated home will have a higher price than that with a few bedrooms.
* The year of which the home was built does not guarantee that the home will sell  at higher/lower price as long as the home fits the taste and preferences of the buyer .

### Recommedation
* The real state agency should encourage the home owners to renovate their homes to have a big sqft_living as the bigger it is,the higher the price of the home is,meaning they would make more money.
* The real state agency should encourage the home owners to renovate their homes to have a more bedrooms and bathrooms as the more rooms a home has the higher the price of the home is,meaning they would make more money.
* The real state agency should consider selling homes that are highly graded because they tend to attract a high interest thus a higher price.
* The real state agency should avoid assuming that since a home was built earlier,it might not sell for a higher case,which is not the case.because as long as the renovated home fits a buyers preferences it can be bought for higher prices.
